# Sweeper Calc 2.0

Sweeper Calc wasn't kept up with, and I wanted a small project to build that would make me have to do a few different 
forms of development.

## Building for Deployment

 - Create a Lightsail instance with the `` script as the launch script.
 - Run [Project In Progress] to parse data... (could do a few things to make that work)
